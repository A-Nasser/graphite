Graphite for jQuery Mobile
===========

Graphite is a curated set of nice, simple, and clean jQuery Mobile themes. Comes with a generator script for building your own with a given base color and base highlight color.

We've included a modified jQuery Mobile base theme that we use to generate the "Graphite" set of themes. This theme has a few changes made to the default theme.

Created by [Ben Sperry](http://bensperry.com/) and [Max Lynch](http://maxlynch.com/) creators of [Codiqa, the jQuery Mobile interface builder](http://codiqa.com/), and Joe Nelson of [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com/) in Madison, Wisconsin.

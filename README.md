jqm-graphite
===========

A curated set of nice, simple jQuery Mobile themes, and a generator script for building your own with a given set of theme preferences.

Created by the creators of [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/) - the interface builder for jQuery Mobile.

We've included a modified jQuery Mobile base theme that we use to generate the "Graphite" set of themes. This theme has a few changes made to the default theme.
